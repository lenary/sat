# sat - Stupid-Simple SAT Solver

I wrote this mostly to prove that I could. I started with the second dumbest
algorithm, DPLL.

I want to implement:
- Backjumping
- Clause Learning
- Watchlists (like minisat's)

But I haven't taken the time to think about these in depth. I hope I can reuse
most of what I've written already, but likely not.
